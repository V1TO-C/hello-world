<h2> The San Francisco 49ers executed a blockbuster trade on Friday, putting them in prime position to nab one of the top quarterbacks in the 2021 NFL Draft. While Clemson's Trevor Lawrence appears to be headed to Jacksonville to become the Jaguars' new QB1, the Niners clearly like the other top prospects at the game's most important position, having given the Dolphins two first-round picks and a third in order to move up nine slots in this year's draft to No. 3 overall.
