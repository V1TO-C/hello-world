<h2> The San Francisco 49ers executed a blockbuster trade on Friday, putting them in prime position to nab one of the top quarterbacks in the 2021 NFL Draft. While Clemson's Trevor Lawrence appears to be headed to Jacksonville to become the Jaguars' new QB1, the Niners clearly like the other top prospects at the game's most important position, having given the Dolphins two first-round picks and a third in order to move up nine slots in this year's draft to No. 3 overall.
 </h2>

<h2>It's not entirely clear what the New York Jets plan to do with the No. 2 pick. They could a) draft a quarterback, b) stick with Sam Darnold and take a top prospect at another position or c) trade out. Given that uncertainty, it's impossible to know exactly which quarterback will be available when San Francisco comes on the clock. Thus, 49ers GM John Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan must believe in the talent and potential of multiple QB prospects not named Trevor Lawrence. While the 49ers continue to insist that Jimmy Garoppolo remains in their plans as a starter in 2021, this kind of aggressive move says the team wants to secure its franchise quarterback for the future over draft weekend.</h2>

<h2>With all of that in mind, I wanted to take a look at Ohio State's Justin Fields, North Dakota State's Trey Lance and BYU's Zach Wilson, assessing how each quarterback could fit into Shanahan's offensive system in San Francisco.</h2>
