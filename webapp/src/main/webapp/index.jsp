<h2> The San Francisco 49ers executed a blockbuster trade on Friday, putting them in prime position to nab one of the top quarterbacks in the 2021 NFL Draft. While Clemson's Trevor Lawrence appears to be headed to Jacksonville to become the Jaguars' new QB1, the Niners clearly like the other top prospects at the game's most important position, having given the Dolphins two first-round picks and a third in order to move up nine slots in this year's draft to No. 3 overall.
 </h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>It's not entirely clear what the New York Jets plan to do with the No. 2 pick. They could a) draft a quarterback, b) stick with Sam Darnold and take a top prospect at another position or c) trade out. Given that uncertainty, it's impossible to know exactly which quarterback will be available when San Francisco comes on the clock. Thus, 49ers GM John Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan must believe in the talent and potential of multiple QB prospects not named Trevor Lawrence. While the 49ers continue to insist that Jimmy Garoppolo remains in their plans as a starter in 2021, this kind of aggressive move says the team wants to secure its franchise quarterback for the future over draft weekend.</h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>With all of that in mind, I wanted to take a look at Ohio State's Justin Fields, North Dakota State's Trey Lance and BYU's Zach Wilson, assessing how each quarterback could fit into Shanahan's offensive system in San Francisco.</h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>The Ohio State star would give the 49ers a different style of playmaker at the position. Fields is a rugged athlete with A+ speed and arm talent. He put up impressive numbers as a two-year starter in Columbus, while displaying an ability to take his game up a notch in marquee contests. Looking back at his performances against Lawrence-led Clemson in each of the past two College Football Playoffs, he has shown the 49ers how he can put a team on his back as the offense's primary playmaker.



Furthermore, Fields' athleticism, mobility and arm talent mesh well with the bootleg action that is featured prominently in Shanahan's scheme. He is fast enough to threaten defensive ends on the edges, which enhances the 49ers' running game by keeping defenders from aggressively pursuing runs to the front side. In addition, Fields is an effective passer off play-action, with the capacity to deliver strikes down the seam or on a variety of in-breaking routes and crossers. San Francisco's play-action-heavy scheme would give Fields a chance to play at a high level early.
